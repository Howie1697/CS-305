Software Security Repo

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Customer-specific financial strategies are the focus of Artemis Financial's consulting services. Their public online application needed to be safe enough to handle sensitive personal and financial data, so they recruited us to create and protect it.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
When doing static testing, I was able to quickly detect any present weaknesses in the code. In order to maintain the integrity and dependability of the company's brand, secure coding is essential.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
Many hours were saved by using a dependency checker, rather than individually checking each of the dependencies for weaknesses.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
In the future, penetration testing should be required to properly identify security flaws.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Once new dependencies were introduced, the dependency check has to be re-run. Otherwise, functionality may be ensured by unit testing and human code review.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Use the Internet as a source of information on current trends in technology and algorithms.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
Mainly my knowlege and usage of SHA-256 encryption algorhytms and utlizing dependency checkers to verify holes in my system
